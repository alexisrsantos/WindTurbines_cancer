# Cancer Rates are not associated with Wind Energy in the U.S.
Here I provide the data and code to conduct a state-level correlation analysis between Wind Energy indicators and Cancer (Indicence, Prevalence, Mortality).

# Results
Here I provide a visualization of the correlation analysis.

The code includes an section for an analysis that excludes Texas (an outlier). 

# Conclusion 
There is no correlation between Wind Energy indicators and any of the state-level. 

# Future directions
Numerous limitations need to be addressed this is a state-level analysis. Future analyses could study whether this association exists at the county level, or if the association/correlation exists with individual data and distance to the turbines.
